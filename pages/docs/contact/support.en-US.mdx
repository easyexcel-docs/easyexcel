- Prioritize suggestions to solve problems by yourself through documentation


## Secondly, it is recommended to solve the problem through `issues`

You can try to search for the issue in the following 2 links. If it does not exist, you can try to create an `issue`.

* Go to [github](https://github.com/alibaba/easyexcel/issues) and search for `issues`
* Go to [gitee](https://gitee.com/easyexcel/easyexcel/issues) and search for `issues`

Solving problems through `issues` can be reviewed by students who encounter the same problem later, so this method is highly recommended.
Regardless of `github` or `gitee`, someone will answer your questions regularly. If it is more urgent, you can ask the DingTalk group Aite group leader after raising the `issue` and send the `issue` address to help solve it.
`QQ` is not allowed to be used by the company, but I sometimes look at it, but the core is definitely DingTalk.

## You can also join DingTalk & QQ group to solve the problem
