# Write Excel

## Annotations

Using annotations is very simple, just add annotations to the corresponding entity class.

### `ExcelProperty`

Used to match excel and entity classes, the parameters are as follows:

| name                  | default value               | describe                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| value           | null                 | Used to match the header in excel. It must match all. If there are multiple row headers, it will match the last row header.                                                                                                                    |
| order           | Integer.MAX_VALUE | The priority is higher than `value`, and the order of entities and data in excel will be matched according to the order of `order`                                                                                                           |
| index           | &#45;1            | The priority is higher than `value` and `order`, and it will be directly assigned to a specific column in excel according to `index`                                                                                                      |
| converter           | 自动选择              | Specify what converter to use for the current field. It will be automatically selected by default. When writing, just implement the `com.alibaba.excel.converters.Converter#convertToExcelData(com.alibaba.excel.converters.WriteConverterContext<T>)` method. |

### `ExcelIgnore`

By default, all fields will match excel. Adding this annotation will ignore this field.

### `ExcelIgnoreUnannotated`

By default, all fields regardless of whether they are annotated with `ExcelProperty` will participate in reading and writing. After adding `ExcelIgnoreUnannotated` annotation, fields without `ExcelProperty` annotation will not participate.

### `DateTimeFormat`

For date conversion, using `String` to receive data in excel date format will call this annotation. The parameters are as follows:

| name                  | default value  | describe                                                             |
|---------------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| value           | null    | Just write with reference to `java.text.SimpleDateFormat`                             |
| use1904windowing           | automatically choose | Time in Excel is a double-precision floating point number stored since 1900, but sometimes the default start date is 1904, so set this value to the default start date of 1904. |

### `NumberFormat`

For digital conversion, using `String` to receive data in excel numeric format will call this annotation.

| name                  | default value  | describe                          |
|---------------------|------|-----------------------------|
| value           | null    | Just write with reference to `java.text.DecimalFormat` |
| roundingMode           | RoundingMode.HALF_UP | Set rounding mode when formatting                    |

## Parameters

### Concept introduction

* `WriteWorkbook` can be understood as an excel
* `WriteSheet` is understood as a form in excel
* `WriteTable` If there are multiple actual tables in a form, you can use `WriteTable`

### Common parameters

`WriteWorkbook`, `WriteSheet`, `WriteTable` will all have parameters. If it is empty, the upper level will be used by default.

| name                  | default value   | describe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| clazz           | null     | Choose one from `head`. To read the class corresponding to the header of the file, you can also use annotations. If neither is specified, all data will be read                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

After 3.3.0, it is placed in ThreadLocal by default. That is to say, the class will be re-parsed every time it is read and written, and the annotation of the class can be modified reflectively. Concurrency scenarios They will not image each other. <br/> THREAD_LOCAL: By default, it will be cached every time it is read and written, but it will not be imaged if it is not the same time<br/> MEMORY: Put it in the global memory, theoretically the performance will be better, but it cannot be reflected, excluded, etc. Modify the exported object<br/> NONE: Without caching, the performance will be worse. It can be considered when it involves writing while reading, and also requires reflection, exclusion and other methods to modify the object. <br/> |

### WriteWorkbook

:::tip
The setting method is as follows. If you cannot find the parameter, check whether it exists in the general parameters.

```java
  EasyExcel.write(fileName, DemoData.class)
             // After the write method and before the sheet method, the parameters of WriteWorkbook are set.
             .sheet("template")
             .doWrite(() -> {
                 // Query data by page
                 return data();
             });
