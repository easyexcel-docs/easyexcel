# Read Excel FAQ

## common problem

### When reading, you need to use spring’s `@Autowired` in `Listener`.

* Option 1: Avoid creating `Listener` classes

```java
         EasyExcel.read(fileName, DemoData.class, new PageReadListener<DemoData>(dataList -> {
             for (DemoData demoData : dataList) {
                 log.info("Read a piece of data{}", JSON.toJSONString(demoData));
             }
         })).sheet().doRead();
```

* Scenario 2
   * Create member variables for `Listener` and pass them in the constructor. Spring must not be allowed to manage `Listener`, and one must be `new` each time it is read.

### Why can't `Listener` be managed by `spring`?

* When reading excel, the method of `com.alibaba.excel.read.listener.ReadListener#invoke` will be called back, and `spring` will cause `Listener` if it manages `Listener`
It becomes a singleton. When files are read concurrently, the same `Listener` will be called back, and it is impossible to distinguish which file was read.

### How to get the list or name of all sheets

There are currently 2 options to read

#### Use a listener to read

If there are no special needs, it is recommended to get the name of the current sheet in the listener.
Read all sheets:

```java
         EasyExcel.read(file, MultipleSheetsData.class, new MultipleSheetsListener()).doReadAll();
```

Then each cell returns to the current sheet:

```java
     @Override
//Called after each line is read
     public void invoke(MultipleSheetsData data, AnalysisContext context) {
        //The name of the current sheet is similar to the encoding obtained
         context.readSheetHolder().getSheetName();
    }

     @Override
     //It will be called after each sheet is read.
     public void doAfterAllAnalysed(AnalysisContext context) {
          //The name of the current sheet is similar to the encoding obtained
         context.readSheetHolder().getSheetName();
     }
```

#### Read directly into the list

If you must get a list of all sheets before reading, please note that the performance of xls here will be worse than the previous method. But the difference is not particularly big.

```java
         ExcelReader excelReader = EasyExcel.read(file, MultipleSheetsData.class, multipleSheetsListener).build();
//all lists
         List<ReadSheet> sheets = excelReader.excelExecutor().sheetList();
         for (ReadSheet readSheet : sheets) {
             // Start reading the data inside one by one
             excelReader.read(readSheet);
         }
         excelReader.finish();
```

### How to get the total number of items in excel

Currently, we can only get an approximate number of items (each excel will record a total number of items, but this total number may not be correct due to various blank lines and other reasons), and it cannot be obtained accurately. You need to get it accurately in the listener. Statistics one by one.
Inside the listener,

```java
analysisContext.readSheetHolder().getApproximateTotalRowNumber();
```

### Modify the configuration of csv file reading

Here is an example of changing the delimiter of csv to ';'

```java
         // Modify the configuration for reading csv files
         String fileName = TestFileUtil.getPath() + "demo" + File.separator + "demo.csv";
         // One file and one reader
         try (ExcelReader excelReader = EasyExcel.read(fileName, DemoData.class, new DemoDataListener()).build()) {
             // ReadWorkbookHolder stores all the information of the Workbook
             ReadWorkbookHolder readWorkbookHolder = excelReader.analysisContext().readWorkbookHolder();
             // Determine that only csv needs to modify the configuration information
             if (readWorkbookHolder instanceof CsvReadWorkbookHolder) {
                 CsvReadWorkbookHolder csvReadWorkbookHolder = (CsvReadWorkbookHolder)readWorkbookHolder;
                 // The bottom layer reads csv using apache's common-csv, so just set CsvFormat
                 ucsvReadWorkbookHolder.setCsvFormat(csvReadWorkbookHolder.getCsvFormat().withDelimiter(';'));
             }

             // Build a sheet. You can specify a name or no here.
             ReadSheet readSheet = EasyExcel.readSheet(0).build();
             //Read a sheet
             excelReader.read(readSheet);
         }
```

## 10M+ file reading instructions (if you feel that the current efficiency is okay, you don’t need to read the rest)

There is no way to handle version 03, and the memory usage is much larger.
Version 07 has a shared string [shared string](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/office/open-xml/working-with-the-shared-string-table)
concept, this will take up a lot of memory. If all is read into the memory, it will be about 3-10 times the size of the excel file. Therefore, easyexcel uses the strategy of storing the file and then deserializing it to read it to save memory. Of course, after file deserialization is required, the efficiency will be reduced, probably by 30-50% (not necessarily, depending on the hit rate, it may exceed 100%)
If you feel that the reading efficiency is still acceptable, use the default one. The permanent occupation (the entire process of reading a single excel) will generally not exceed 50M (most likely 30M), and the remaining temporary GC will be recycled quickly.

### Now `easyexcel` defaults to large file processing scheme

By default, large file processing will automatically determine that shared strings less than 5M will be stored in memory, which takes up about 15-50M of memory. If they exceed 5M, file storage will be used, and then about 10 batches of 100 items will be stored, with a total of 20,000 temporary items. Data is in memory. Except for the memory occupied by the shared string, the other occupied memory is small, so it can be estimated to be 2M, so by default, a super large file can be read with about 20M.

### Turn on rapid mode

You can turn on the rapid mode yourself and test the memory usage. If it feels as expected, you can turn it on directly.
If the maximum number of files is only a dozen or two hundred thousand, then Excel is only a dozen or twenty M, and there will not be high concurrency, and the memory will be large. In this case, you can consider turning on the speed mode.

```java
  // Force the use of memory storage, so that a 20M excel uses 150M (many temporary objects, so 100M will always be GC) memory
// This will be much more efficient than the complex strategy above
    // Let me explain here again. It just adds a readCache(new MapCache()) parameter. The rest is written with reference to other demos. It is not written in full here.
   EasyExcel.read().readCache(new MapCache());
```

### It has high concurrency requirements and often has super large files.

```java
  // The first parameter means how many M shared strings will be stored in files in MB. The default is 5M.
// The second parameter is how many batches of data to put in the memory. The default is 20 batches.
SimpleReadCacheSelector simpleReadCacheSelector=new SimpleReadCacheSelector();
simpleReadCacheSelector.setMaxUseMapCacheSize(5L);
simpleReadCacheSelector.setMaxCacheActivateBatchCount(20);
EasyExcel.read().readCacheSelector(simpleReadCacheSelector);
```

* maxCacheActivateBatchCount is the detailed description of the previous second parameter
When easyexcel uses file storage, it will split the shared string into a batch of 100 items and then put them in the file storage. Then excel reads the shared string most likely in order, so by default 20 batches of 100 pieces of data are placed in the memory. After a hit, it returns directly. If there is no hit, it reads the file. Therefore, you cannot set it too small. If it is too small, it will be difficult to hit and the file will be read all the time. If it is too large, it will take up too much memory.
* How to judge whether maxCacheActivateBatchCount needs to be adjusted
Turning on the debug log will output `Already put :4000000`. The last output can probably be concluded to be 400W, and then looking at `Cache misses count: 4001`, the value is 4K, 400W/4K=1000
This means that `maxCacheActivateBatchCount` is already very reasonable. If it is less than 500, the problem will be very big. 500 to 1000 should be fine.
