## common problem

## Fields in the template are not replaced

Use the template generated by EasyExcel to fill in the result, and the filled fields are not replaced.
The cause of this problem is more complicated. Interested students can learn about: ShardingStrings. When writing, EasyExcel does not use ShardingStrings in order to save memory.

#### solution:

When exporting the template, use the parameter inMemory=true.

```java
// Using inMemory(true) here will trigger writing to ShardingStrings, but in this way all the data will be in memory, so it is easy to OOM
// But if we just need to export the template, there are not many fields, so the problem is not big.
// Note here that you should add this parameter when exporting the template. Do not add it when actually writing data, otherwise it will easily lead to OOM.
EasyExcel.write(fileName, DemoData.class).inMemory(true).sheet("template").doWrite(fillData());
```
