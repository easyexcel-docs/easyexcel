### How to choose between filling and writing when writing in excel?

In fact, filling does not take up a lot of memory. It also uses file cache and is written in a unified manner. If the exported content has complex formats, it is recommended to directly use a template and then fill it (the filled data will automatically be formatted). If the format is relatively simple, it is recommended to write it directly. Relatively speaking, the performance of direct export is still a little higher.

### About `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`

[Lombok](https://www.projectlombok.org/) is used for reading and writing objects. It will automatically generate `get`, `set`. If not needed, create the object yourself and generate `get`,` set`.

### As long as some fields match excel (the content written in excel does not match well, etc.)

`easyexcel` defaults to all entity fields participating in reading and writing, regardless of whether you add the `@ExcelProperty` annotation

* If your version is lower than 2.1.6, it is recommended to upgrade to the above version
* After the upgrade, add the `@ExcelIgnoreUnannotated` annotation at the top of the class. After adding this annotation, only adding `@ExcelProperty` will participate in reading and writing.

### `csv` reading and writing support

It is supported in version `3.0.0-beta1` and will be automatically judged when reading. Just specify `excelType` when writing.

```java
    EasyExcel.write(fileName, DemoData.class)
             // Specify the export type as csv
             .excelType(ExcelTypeEnum.CSV)
             .sheet("template")
             .doWrite(() -> {
                 // Query data by page
                 return data();
             });
```

## Compatibility issues

### Be sure to use 2.0.5+ to read files

From 2.0.0-beta1 to 2.0.2, there is a small probability that numbers will be lost.

### Notes on using the beta version

Note to students using the beta version, it is recommended to check if there is an official version in a month (usually the official version will be upgraded within a month)
, if any, change it to the official version, because the beta version is prone to bugs, so don’t skip the upgrade. For example, if you are using 2.1.0-beat1, it is recommended to upgrade to 2.1.x after one month. The first and second places are not Change, the third one can use the latest one.

### About version selection

:::tip
If poi has not been used in the project and the jdk version is between 8-17, use the latest version directly without hesitation.
:::
If POI or JDK version less than 8 has been used in the project, please refer to the table below to make your choice.

| Version                 | poi dependency version (support range)        | jdk version support range    | Remark                                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 3.1.0+             | 4.1.2 (4.1.2 - 5.2.2) | jkd8 - jdk17 | Recommended to use, will update the version                                 |
| 3.0.0-beta1 - 3.0.5 | 4.1.2 (4.1.2 - 5.2.2) | jkd8 - jdk11 | It is not recommended to introduce this version into new projects. Unless there is a super serious bug, it will not be updated again.                |
| 2.0.0-beta1-2.2.11 | 3.17 (3.17 - 4.1.2)   | jdk6 - jdk11 | It is not recommended to introduce this version into new projects. It is not recommended to use it unless it is jdk6. It will not be updated unless it has a super serious bug. |
| 1+版本               | 3.17 (3.17 - 4.1.2)   | jdk6 - jdk11 | It is not recommended to introduce this version into new projects. It has super serious bugs and will no longer be updated.                   |

:::important
For version 3+ of easyexcel, when using version 5+ of poi, you need to introduce the package of version 5+ of poi yourself and manually exclude: poi-ooxml-schemas, for example:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba</groupId>
    <artifactId>easyexcel</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.0</version>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <artifactId>poi-ooxml-schemas</artifactId>
            <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

:::

### Compatibility issues such as `NoSuchMethodException`, `ClassNotFoundException`, `NoClassDefFoundError` and other problems occur

There is a high probability that it is a jar conflict, which may be due to the following reasons.

* Directly `clean` the project to see if it is feasible
* `poi` version conflict (the project already contains other versions of poi), refer to: [About version selection] (#About version selection) to specify the version.
* `ehcache`
Version conflict, open [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.alibaba/easyexcel](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.alibaba/easyexcel)
, open the corresponding version and check the required `ehcache` version

### About version upgrade

* It is not recommended to upgrade across major versions, especially across 2 major versions.
* After a major version upgrade, it is recommended to retest the relevant content.
*Upgrade from 2+ to 3+, the following 3 places are incompatible:
* There will be problems if you use a custom interceptor to modify the style (no compilation error will be reported)

```java
//Previous writing method
@Override
protected void setHeadCellStyle(Cell cell, Head head, Integer relativeRowIndex) {
             cell.setCellStyle(style);
  }

// Current writing method 1
// This needs to be tested after writing. It is still the old code. No matter what interceptor is used, it can be written like this.
// This will cause the formatted data to become invalid.
     protected void setHeadCellStyle(CellWriteHandlerContext context) {
             cell.setCellStyle(style);

          // Here we need to clear the style of WriteCellData, otherwise there is an interceptor behind it. FillStyleCellWriteHandler will set WriteCellStyle to
          // Going inside the cell will cause your settings to be different.
          context.getFirstCellData().setWriteCellStyle(null);
     }


// Current writing method 2 recommended
// This solution is reliable. I used poi's CellStyle before and now I use WriteCellStyle. The input parameters are basically the same.
     protected void setHeadCellStyle(CellWriteHandlerContext context) {
                      // first cell
                         // As long as it is not the header, there will definitely be data. Of course, in the case of fill, context.getCellDataList() may be required. This requires looking at the template, because a cell will have multiple WriteCellData
                         WriteCellData<?> cellData = context.getFirstCellData();
                         //Here you need to go to cellData to get the style
                         //A very important reason is that WriteCellStyle is bound to dataFormatData. To put it simply, for example, if you add DateTimeFormat
                         //, the dataFormatData in writeCellStyle has been changed. If you create a new WriteCellStyle yourself, the annotated style may be invalid.
                         // Then getOrCreateStyle is used to return a style. If it is empty, create one and return
                         WriteCellStyle writeCellStyle = cellData.getOrCreateStyle();
                         writeCellStyle.setFillForegroundColor(IndexedColors.RED.getIndex());
                         // Here you need to specify FillPatternType as FillPatternType.SOLID_FOREGROUND
                         writeCellStyle.setFillPatternType(FillPatternType.SOLID_FOREGROUND);
     }
```

* When reading, an exception is thrown in `invoke`, and an additional layer of `ExcelAnalysisException` will not be encapsulated (no compilation error will be reported)
   * When catching exceptions, there is no need to use `getCause` anymore.
* Style and other annotations involve changes in `boolean` or some enumeration values, and a new default value will be added (it will compile and report an error, just change the annotation)
   * Just change this directly

### I can do it locally, but why can’t I publish it to the online environment?

There is a high probability that it is caused by the lack of font library. There are 2 solutions:

* Install fonts (recommended)
   * Check whether the fonts are installed on the server. The jdk8 font needs to be installed by yourself. Please install the fonts: dejavu-sans-fonts and fontconfig. Add the font installation command in the dockerfile:
```RUN yum install dejavu-sans-fonts fontconfig -y```
   * Run directly in ordinary online environment: ```yum install dejavu-sans-fonts fontconfig -y```
* Turn on the memory processing mode (not recommended, it can be considered if the data is within 1W, it is easy to OOM if it is too large)

```java
         EasyExcel
         .write(fileName, DemoData.class)
         // Core this configuration starts memory processing mode
         .inMemory(Boolean.TRUE)
         .sheet("template")
         .doWrite(data());
```

## High frequency problem

### Why can't some of my fields be read or written?

* `Cglib` is used to read and write reflection objects, so member variables must conform to the camel case specification. Please confirm whether it conforms to the camel case specification.
   * In `3.0.0-beta1`, some non-camel cases are compatible, but it is still not recommended to use non-camel cases.
* Uses `@Accessors(chain = true)` of `lombok` and cannot be read by `Cglib`
   * It is recommended to use `@Builder` to replace `@Accessors(chain = true)`

### `NoSuchMethodException`, `ClassNotFoundException`, `NoClassDefFoundError` and other exceptions occur

Usually there is a problem with version compatibility. Please refer to: [About version selection]

### `NullPointerException at sun.awt.FontConfiguration.getVersion` , `Could not initialize class sun.awt.X11FontManage`

This is usually caused by a lack of fonts. Please refer to: I can do it locally, but why can’t I publish it to an online environment?
