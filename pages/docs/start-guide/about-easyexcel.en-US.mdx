# EasyExcel
The more famous frameworks for Java parsing and generating Excel include Apache poi and jxl. But they all have a serious problem that they consume a lot of memory. POI has a set of SAX mode APIs that can solve some memory overflow problems to a certain extent, but POI still has some flaws, such as the decompression and storage of the 07 version of Excel. It is done in memory, and memory consumption is still very large.
easyexcel rewrites poi's analysis of the 07 version of Excel. A 3M excel still requires about 100M of memory to parse with POI sax. Using easyexcel can reduce it to a few MB, and no matter how large the excel is, there will be no memory overflow; version 03 relies on POI's sax mode encapsulates model conversion in the upper layer, making it easier and more convenient for users.

# 16M memory, 23 seconds to read 75M (46W rows and 25 columns) Excel (version 3.2.1+)

Of course, there is also a speed mode that is faster, but the memory usage will be a little more than 100M.

## Quick start
### Read Excel
DEMO code address: [https://github.com/alibaba/easyexcel/blob/master/easyexcel-test/src/test/java/com/alibaba/easyexcel/test/demo/read/ReadTest.java](https: //github.com/alibaba/easyexcel/blob/master/easyexcel-test/src/test/java/com/alibaba/easyexcel/test/demo/read/ReadTest.java)

```java
     /**
      *Easiest to read
      * <p>1. Create the entity object corresponding to excel. Refer to {@link DemoData}
      * <p>2. Since excel is read line by line by default, you need to create a callback listener for excel line by line. Refer to {@link DemoDataListener}
      * <p>3. Just read it directly
      */
     @Test
     public void simpleRead() {
         String fileName = TestFileUtil.getPath() + "demo" + File.separator + "demo.xlsx";
         // Here you need to specify which class to use for reading, and then the stream of the first sheet file will be automatically closed.
         EasyExcel.read(fileName, DemoData.class, new DemoDataListener()).sheet().doRead();
     }
```

### Write Excel

      */
     @Test
     public void simpleWrite() {
         String fileName = TestFileUtil.getPath() + "write" + System.currentTimeMillis() + ".xlsx";
         // Here you need to specify which class to use for reading, and then write to the first sheet, whose name is template. Then the file stream will be automatically closed.
         // If you want to use 03 here, just pass in the excelType parameter
         EasyExcel.write(fileName, DemoData.class).sheet("template").doWrite(data());
